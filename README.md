# About

Prototyper this is desktop application to make UI prototypes.

When you first time launch Prototyper you will see window with text editor (one and alone)
tab. This tabbed text editor is the place where you can describe
your new project.

Page can be created through the context menu on the tab, context menu in pages navigation
or through the menu. When you create page you will see tool bar with tools for drawing.

In such a way you describe prototype of you project. Once as you are ready
you can export your project to the PDF, HTML or SVG images of pages.

And Prototyper licensed under GNU GPL v3.0!!!

# Wanted

I'm looking for a free designer to create icon of copy text format action
in 16x16 and 22x22 sizes, and a cursor shape for applying text format (22x22).
Something similar like in MS Word but in KDE Oxygen icons style. You can look
at icons in use in this application in src/Core/img folder.

# Status

Under construction.

# Getting from Repository

After clone update submodules with the next command:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

# TODO

 - [ ] Add comments to drawing area (pages)

Prototyper this is desktop application to make UI prototypes, simple integration
into project's documentation, and so on...

First of all I have to say that I see Prototyper as a software for creation of UI
prototypes for desktop and mobile applications. I do not set a goal to create prototyping
software for Web-pages, but may be Prototyper will be usefull for Web-pages too.

And Prototyper will be released under GNU GPL v3.0!!!
